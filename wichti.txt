A picture in a model upload:
    field_name = models.ImageField(upload_to=None, height_field=None, width_field=None, max_length=100)


Or for example in the class:

class MyModel(models.Model):
    # file will be uploaded to MEDIA_ROOT / uploads
    upload = models.ImageField(upload_to ='uploads/')
    # or...
    # file will be saved to MEDIA_ROOT / uploads / 2015 / 01 / 30
    upload = models.ImageField(upload_to ='uploads/% Y/% m/% d/')
